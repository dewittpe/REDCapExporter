I have corrected a spelling error in the DESCRIPTION file and added a web
reference for the API as requested.

## Note from CRAN from First resubmission

> Please do not repeat the package name in the title.

I have changed the title of the package.


>Please add missing .Rd documentation for all functions, e..g.
>write_descritption_file() in write.R
>I also suggest renaming this function to write_description_file().

>Please add small executable examples in your Rd-files to illustrate the
>use of the exported function but also enable automatic testing.

>Please fix and resubmit, and document what was changed in the submission
>comments.
