Description: Export all data, including metadata, from a REDCap (Research
    Electronic Data Capture) Project via the REDCap API
    <https://projectredcap.org/wp-content/resources/REDCapTechnicalOverview.pdf>.
    The exported (meta)data will be processed and formatted into a stand alone R
    data package which can be installed and shared between researchers.  Several
    default reports are generated as vignettes in the resulting package.
